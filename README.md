# ![snowcone](snowcone.png) snowcone

Snowcone is a [snowball](http://snowballstem.org/) compiler for Go.  Currently, it is only capable of lexing and parsing the source.  It cannot yet generate the corresponding Go code.

## Status

**EXPERIMENTAL** â€“ the API will change once we add the ability to generate code.

# TODO
- Parser
    - `get` directives
    - review grammar - rule expanding `C` to  `= S`, I encountered a reduce/reduce conflict that i haven't yet resolved
- Build interpreter to evaluate externals on user supplied input
- Generate Go code to execute externals in external apps

# Open Questions
- What does `?` command do?  Manual only includes it in the grammar and says it's a debugging aid.
